    Attractiveness - Research has shown that we not only consciously prefer attractive people but we associate their appearance with an inherent ‘goodness’ which then reflects directly on the product (also called the halo effect), but attractive faces instantly produce a positive feeling in the viewer. Attractive individuals produce similar physiological responses in viewers to those observed when people are presented with money.
