    <div class="margin grid padding">
        <p><strong><a href="http://www.theworldcounts.com/counters/shocking_environmental_facts_and_statistics/negative_effects_of_consumerism">Environment </a></strong><br>Impact on the environment when mining or farming materials especially on the large scale that is needed for mass production is extremely devastating to the environment. Distruction ranges from strip mining for materials to dowsing crops in a cocktail of chemicals.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://climateandcapitalism.com/2011/12/03/are-consumers-destroying-the-earth/">End of Life </a></strong><br>Production is not the only aspect of negative impact on environment. When an object reaches end of life it is most of the time put in an early forced isolation. This is especially detrimental since all of these materials will be wasted in a landfill or incinerator causing more pollution through any potential chemical off gassing. The earth does not have the resources to keep up with these wasteful ways.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/making-difference/sweatshops-where-corporate-greed-and-human-misery-meet">Social Impact </a></strong><br>Social issues surrounding sweatshops and slave conditions of laborers is also something to keep in mind. People who are desperate for money to survive are the ones who are abused the most. Sweatshops in developing countries are all too common since laws are near non existent.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://suziemaddock.com/how-to-be-a-mindful-consumer/">Alternatives </a></strong><br>It is important to learn about what products to buy instead. Certain materials have less of an environmental impact than others. A bamboo table might be marked as an eco friendly choice but the environmental impact from transportation is ignored. For a truly better alternative it would be more environmentally friendly to purchase a good quality table from a thrift shop.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://www.themindfulword.org/2014/conscious-consumerism-thinking-consequences-actions/">Research </a></strong><br>There is a need to look deeper into the company itself. Thoroughly researching a company or product is necessary since many companies commonly lie and practice greenwashing to keep up and be trendy.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/if-its-free-how-much-does_b_10727872">Avoid Manipulation </a></strong><br>Also important to avoid advertisers manipulative techniques. Having that awareness for how things are marketed towards you is important for developing a critical lense in product purchasing. That want, craving or desire might be not even come from you. It could be fabricated from the bombardment of advertisements you are exposed to daily.</p>

    <h2>Mindset</h2>
    <div class="into">
        <p class="intro">The key to mindful consumption does not solely exist in a 5 step tutorial. It is a mindset and lifestyle change. A critical lense and self reflection is needed. Thinking into the future and past the instant gratification that comes from a product purchase takes a shift in one’s way of thinking. Here are a few self reflection questions to ask yourself.</p>

    <div class="center">
      <ol class="question">
        <li>Is this a want or a need?</li>
        <li>Does all of this stuff really make you happy?</li>
        <li>What are your goals or values?</li>
        <li>Be determined and resist temptation.</li>
        <li>Don’t be afraid to say no.</li>
        <li>Think before buying just to buy.</li>
        <li>Consume without instant gratification in mind.</li>
        <li>Will this object last and still be functional for many years?</li>
